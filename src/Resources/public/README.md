# Note
The files `admin.css`, `admin.js`, and `polyfills.js` are copied from the `zicht/dynamic-forms-bundle`.

Ideally the `JsonSchemaType`, and its associated js and css code, should be made into a small Symfony bundle
that is used by both the `zicht/dynamic-forms-bundle` and the `zicht/key-value-bundle`.
